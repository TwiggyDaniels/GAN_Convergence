# GAN_Convergence

This notebook contains an experiment to empirically compare the convergence of a standard GAN with that of a Wasserstein GAN of identical architecture (with the exception of outputs). The models attempt to generate greyscale images utilizing the CelebA dataset.

### Installing

Install the necessary packages
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### TODO
* Citations for CelebA dataset
* Embed some images of the generated faces
* Clean up directory structure
* Split the actual model into a .py file instead of a class within the notebook
* Re-edit the latex report and upload it
* Improve project description
